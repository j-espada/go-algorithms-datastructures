# go-algorithms-datastructures
In this repository I will be implementing classic algorithms and data structures in Go in free time as a side project.
I will also do the necessary unit tests to the code.

I expect to implement the following:

## Sorting algorithms
1. Bubble sort
2. Insertion sort
3. Bucket sort
4. Counting sort
5. Radix sort
6. Quick sort
7. Merge sort
8. Shell sort

## Data structures
1- Linked list
2- Double linked list
3- ArrayList
4- Stack
5- Queue
6- Disjoint set a.k.a union-find
7- Diffrent representation of graph (adjacency matrix, adjacency list and CSR)
8- Binary heap
9- Leftist heap
10- Binomial heap

## Graph algorithms
1- Kruskal
2- Prim
3- Dijkstra
4- Optimum branching a.k.a edmonds algorithm
