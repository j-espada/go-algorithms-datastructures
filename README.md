# go-algorithms-datastructures
In this repository I will be implementing classic algorithms and data structures in Go in free time as a side project.
I will also do the necessary unit tests to the code.

I expect to implement the following:

## Sorting algorithms
1. Bubble sort - Implemented
2. Insertion sort - Implemented
3. Bucket sort - Implemented
4. Counting sort - Implemented
5. Radix sort
6. Quick sort
7. Merge sort
8. Shell sort
9. Heap sort

## Data structures
1. Linked list - Implemented
2. Double linked list
3. ArrayList - Implemented
4. Stack - Implemented
5. Queue - Implemented
6. Disjoint set a.k.a union-find
7. Diffrent representation of graph (adjacency matrix, adjacency list and CSR)
8. Binary heap
9. Leftist heap
10. Binomial heap
11. Rank pairing heap^*
12. Fibonacci heap^*
13. Link-cut trees^*

## Graph algorithms
1. Kruskal
2. Prim
3. Dijkstra
4. Optimum branching a.k.a edmonds algorithm
5. Bellman-ford
6. Floyd-warshall
